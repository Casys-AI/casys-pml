# Workflow Templates Configuration (Story 5.2)
#
# Define common tool sequences to bootstrap the graph.
# Tool ID format: serverId:toolName (from your MCP server config)
#
# TWO FORMATS SUPPORTED:
#
# 1. steps (linear sequence):
#    steps: [A, B, C] → creates edges: A→B, B→C
#
# 2. edges (explicit DAG):
#    edges: [[A,B], [A,C], [B,D], [C,D]]
#    → creates edges: A→B, A→C, B→D, C→D (parallel branches)
#
# Use `steps` for simple workflows, `edges` for complex DAGs with branching.
# Cannot use both in the same workflow.
#
# IMPORTANT: Replace the examples below with YOUR actual MCP tool IDs.
# Run `agentcards status` to see available tools from your configured servers.

# EXAMPLES (uncomment and adapt to your MCP servers)
# ============================================================================
#
# Example 1: Linear sequence (steps format)
# - name: parse_json_file
#   steps:
#     - filesystem:read_file
#     - json:parse
#
# Example 2: DAG with parallel branches (edges format)
# - name: fetch_and_process
#   edges:
#     - [api:fetch, transform:parse]
#     - [api:fetch, validate:schema]    # fetch leads to TWO tools (parallel)
#     - [transform:parse, db:save]
#     - [validate:schema, db:save]      # save waits for both
#
# Example 3: Web research with branching
# - name: web_research
#   edges:
#     - [tavily:search, browser:fetch]
#     - [browser:fetch, llm:summarize]
#     - [browser:fetch, llm:extract_entities]  # parallel analysis
#
# To find your tool IDs:
# 1. Check your MCP config (~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json)
# 2. Run: agentcards status
# 3. Look at server_id:tool_name format in the output
