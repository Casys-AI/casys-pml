## Guidelines

### Title
- Clear and specific
- Include the main technology/concept
- Avoid clickbait but be engaging

### Introduction
- Set the context quickly
- Why should the reader care?
- What will they learn?

### Technical Content
- Be specific but accessible
- Include code examples when helpful
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"

### Tone
- Professional but conversational
- Share genuine insights and struggles
- Be humble about what you don't know

### Length
- Target: 800-1500 words
- Enough detail to be useful
- Not so long it loses readers
