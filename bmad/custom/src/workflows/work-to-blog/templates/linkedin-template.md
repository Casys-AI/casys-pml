# LinkedIn Template - Short Engaging Post

Use this structure for LinkedIn posts.

---

## Structure

```markdown
{{hook_first_line}}

{{story_paragraph_1}}

{{story_paragraph_2}}

{{key_takeaway}}

{{call_to_action}}

{{hashtags}}
```

## Guidelines

### Hook (First Line)
- CRITICAL: This determines if people read more
- Start with something surprising, contrarian, or relatable
- Examples:
  - "I spent 3 days debugging something that took 5 minutes to fix."
  - "Unpopular opinion: [controversial but defensible take]"
  - "TIL: [surprising fact]"
  - "The best code I wrote this week was the code I deleted."

### Story (2-3 short paragraphs)
- Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences MAX
- Use line breaks for readability
- Share the journey, not just the result
- Include a specific detail that makes it real

### Key Takeaway
- One clear lesson
- Make it actionable if possible
- Something the reader can use today

### Call to Action
- Ask a question to drive engagement
- Examples:
  - "What's your experience with X?"
  - "Have you faced something similar?"
  - "Agree or disagree?"

### Hashtags
- 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Mix of broad (#programming) and specific (#deno #typescript)
- Place at the end, not inline

## Tone

- Conversational and authentic
- Share struggles, not just wins
- Avoid jargon - explain or skip
- Be yourself, not a corporate voice

## Length

- Target: 150-300 words
- Short enough to read in 30 seconds
- Long enough to provide value

## Emojis

- Use sparingly (0-3 per post)
- Only if it fits your voice
- Never in the hook line
