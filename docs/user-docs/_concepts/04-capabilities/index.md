## Overview

Capabilities are the core innovation of PML:

- **Discovery** - Agents combine tools in novel ways
- **Capture** - PML extracts the pattern and stores it
- **Reuse** - Other agents can now use this capability

A capability is essentially a "recipe" - a proven way to combine tools to achieve a goal.
